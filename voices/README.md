# Video Puppet voice control example

This example shows how to set voices for different scenes in Video Puppet. 

Check out the outcome in [`result.mp4`](result.mp4).

## Try it out

Upload the [`script`](script) directory to a Video Puppet project. The main script file is [`source.yml`](script/source.yml).

## How it works

To set the voice for the whole document, use a `voice` property on the top level, such as this:

```yml
size: 720p
voice: William
scenes:
# your scenes
```

To set the voice for an individual scene, make the scene `narration` element a key-value map, then use the `voice` property of that object. Move the contents of the narration into the `text` sub-element:

```yml
scenes:
  - image: london.jpg
    narration:
      text: Passengers will instead be boarding a plane belonging to a Belgian budget airline.
      voice: Elisabeth
```
