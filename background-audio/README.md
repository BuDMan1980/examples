# Narakeet background sounds example 

This example shows how to add a background audio to Narakeet. 

Check out the outcome in [`result.mp4`](result.mp4).

## Try it out

Upload the [`script`](script) directory to a Narakeet project. The main script file is [`source.md`](script/source.md).

## How it works

To add background music to your video, just provide a `background` top-level property in the page header. You can specify an audio file, or a combination of an audio file and volume separated by a space. The value should be a number reflecting the multiplier for the original volume (`1` is default, equal to the original volume).

You can use WAV, MP3 and M4A files. The sound will be automatically repeated to match the total duration of the video.

The following header will include `sound.wav` at full volume:

```yml
---
size: 720p
background: sound.wav
---
```

The following examples will include `sound.wav` at half volume:

```yml
---
size: 720p
background: sound.wav 0.5
---
```
