# Video Puppet background sounds example 

This example shows how to add a background audio to Video Puppet. 

Check out the outcome in [`result.mp4`](result.mp4).

## Try it out

Upload the [`script`](script) directory to a Video Puppet project. The main script file is [`source.yml`](script/source.yml).

## How it works

To add background music to your video, just provide a `background` top-level property, and add the sub-property `audio` pointing to an audio file. You can use WAV and MP3 files. The sound will be automatically repeated to match the total duration of the video.

You can also set the `volume` sub-property, controlling the relative volume of the sound in the file. The value should be a number reflecting the multiplier for the original volume (`1` is default, equal to the original volume).


```yml
size: 720p
background:
    audio: 0ff22a15475e27fcc200f6d618a9-orig.wav
    volume: 0.3
scenes:
  ...
```
